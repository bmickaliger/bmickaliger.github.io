						<b>B.S. in Astronomy,</b> Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY<br />
						August 2019 - August 2023 <br /><br />
						<ul>
						  <li><b>Astronomy Major:</b> With my astronomy major, I learned a lot about topics in both astronomy and physics, spanning the fundamental physical laws underlying nature and how they apply to astronomical objects such as stars, galaxies, planets, and compact objects. Along the way, I also strengthened my skills in many related areas, including programming, mathematics, writing, presenting, problem-solving, research, and teamwork.</li>					
						  <ul><ul>
						    <li><b>Astronomy Courses:</b> Introductory Astronomy, Planetary Science, Cosmology, Exoplanets, Stars &amp; Radiation, Galaxies.</li>
						    <li><b>Physics Courses:</b> Classical Physics, Modern Physics, Waves &amp; Optics, Electromagnetic Theory, Mechanics, Thermodynamics.</li>
						    <li><b>Programming Courses:</b> Computation for Physics and Astronomy, Data Analysis with Python.</li>
						    <li><b>Math Courses:</b> Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Applied Real Analysis.<br /></li>
						  </ul></ul>
													  
						  <li><b>Personal Interest:</b> My time at Stony Brook University ignited new passions of mine outside of my major and minor, namely computer science and science communication. While important on their own, my experiences in these classes also served to supplement what I learned through my major.</li>					
						  <ul><ul>
						    <li><b>Computer Science Courses:</b> Computer Science Principles, Object-Oriented Programming, Foundations of Computer Science, Data Structures, Programming in MATLAB for Engineers, Python for Scientific Computing.</li>
						    <li><b>Science Communication Courses:</b> Introduction to Science Communication, Talking Science, Advanced Research Writing.<br /></li>
						  </ul></ul>
													
						  <li><b>Clubs and Activities:</b></li>		
						  <ul><ul>
						    <li><b>Astronomy Club:</b> I was an active member of Astronomy Club from Fall 2019 to Spring 2023, and regularly attended and participated in meetings for all four years.</li>
						    <li><b>AstroFest 2022 and 2023 Volunteer:</b> AstroFest is an annual astronomy outreach event that is aimed towards Stony Brook University students as well as the general public living in the town of Stony Brook. The SBU Astronomy Club hosts AstroFest alongside other physics, math, and science clubs such as Society of Physics Students (SPS), Science Olympiad, the SBU Robotics Team, and more. For AstroFest 2022, I ran a table where I gave a presentation on moon phases and eclipses, and in 2023 I improved upon my 2022 presentation by including a physical model of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. This model allowed an interactive aspect of my verbal presentation for guests to try to recreate different lunar phases and differentiate between lunar and solar eclipses, with a candy prize as an incentive for engagement.
						    <li><b>Food Pantry Volunteer:</b> I became a weekly volunteer at the food pantry on campus midway through my sophomore year and continued volunteering until I became the undergraduate coordinator in my senior year. More information can be found <a href="experience.html">here</a>.<br /> </li>
