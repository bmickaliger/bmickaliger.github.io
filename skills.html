						<b>Programming:</b><br />
						<ul>
						  <li><b>Python:</b> I have been using Python since December 2019. Originally self-taught through online courses and individual practice, I later enrolled in Python-based computer science courses to formalize my knowledge and learn how to apply it with more challenging computational projects.</li>
							<ul>
							  <li><b>Courses:</b> Computer Science Principles, Data Analysis with Python, Python for Scientific Computing.</li>
							  <li><b>Projects:</b> Creating graphs and analyzing data through regression and curve fitting with <code>numpy</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> for weekly physics labs; N-body integration with <a href="https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><font color="#91D0EF">REBOUND</font></a> to simulate the short-term orbital evolution of the TRAPPIST-1 system.</li>
							</ul>
						  <li><b>Java:</b> I learned Java over the course of a year through a handful of online summer courses. Expanding on my knowledge of programming from Python, my experience with Java gave me a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming and complex data structures composed of multiple objects dependent on each other.</li>
							<ul>
							  <li><b>Courses:</b> Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures.</li>
							  <li><b>Projects:</b> Menu-driven applications such as store inventories, playlists, and email inboxes, while utilizing data structures such as queues, trees, and stacks; functional game of Tic-Tac-Toe with user input competing against a "player" with randomized moves.</li>
							</ul>
						  <li><b>Fortran:</b> I learned Fortran in a semester-long course while building on my prior knowledge of programming from Python and Java. My experience with Fortran was applied exclusively towards computational applications in physics and mathematics.</li>
							<ul>
							  <li><b>Courses:</b> Computation for Physics and Astronomy.</li>
							  <li><b>Projects:</b> Polynomial root-finding using the Newton-Raphson Method; solving Poisson's equation using the relaxation method; calculating the radial distribution function for a crystal lattice.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<b>Science Communication:</b><br />
						<ul>
						  <li><b>Public Talks:</b> As an astronomy educator at the Vanderbilt Planetarium, I regularly give live presentations to audiences of up to 140 people. These presentations range from 15 to 45 minutes, and include speaking about a given topic over a microphone while also running a visual presentation to accompany my voice. The visuals are impressive, utilizing the full-dome capabilities of the planetarium software to explore dark skies not visible from Long Island, to full-dome projections of HST and JWST images, to 3D simulations of galactic surveys to explore the furthest reaches of the universe. While controlling these visuals, I also speak to them in a way that is easily understood by the general public with little to no prior knowledge of astronomy, while also being appropriate for people of all ages. The process includes a lot of multitasking and prior preparation to ensure that these live talks are accurate, engaging, comprehensive, and cohesive.</li>
						  <li><b>Short Presentations:</b></li>
						  <li><b>Recorded Videos:</b></li>
						</ul>
						</div>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<b>Traditional Office Applications:</b> I am proficient in Microsoft Office programs such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. as well as their Google Suite equivalents of Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc. I have been using these programs for many years for school projects, assignments, and presentations, as well as for my own personal use.
						</div>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<b>Data Entry:</b> I have done extensive data entry for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Throughout high school and college, I would utilize Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets during experiments in science labs to record data for later analysis using equations and functions within the program. During my time as the Undergraduate Coordinator at the SBU Food Pantry, I would also utilize Excel and Sheets to sort and search through large amounts of data from our PantrySoft software in order to gather information about our clientele base.
